    <p id="caption">Caitlyn Throughout the Years</p>
    <ul>
      <p id="season1">Season 1</p>
      <li>Caitlyn is introduced as an ambitious young woman who rejects the expectations of her aristocratic family. Rather than pursuing a life of luxury, she chooses to join the Piltover Enforcers, driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to make a difference. Caitlyn’s idealism often clashes with the corruption and bureaucracy within Piltover’s law enforcement system.</li>
      <li>Her investigation of the explosion at Jayce’s lab and its connection to Zaun leads her to Vi, an imprisoned fighter from Zaun who is knowledgeable about the criminal underworld. Caitlyn frees Vi from Stillwater Hold, forming an unlikely partnership that becomes central to the story. Despite their vastly different upbringings, Caitlyn and Vi develop mutual respect and trust as they work together to uncover the growing tensions between Piltover and Zaun.</li>
      <li>Through her alliance with Vi, Caitlyn gains firsthand exposure to the struggles of Zaun’s oppressed citizens. This challenges her privileged worldview and deepens her understanding of systemic inequality. Her experiences in Zaun strengthen her resolve to fight for justice, not just in Piltover but for both cities. Caitlyn’s compassion and moral clarity often serve as a counterbalance to Vi’s more impulsive tendencies, making their partnership both dynamic and complementary.</li>
      <li>Caitlyn also plays a key role in uncovering Silco‘s schemes and his use of Shimmer to consolidate power in Zaun. Her investigative prowess helps expose the corruption and danger threatening both cities. However, as tensions escalate between Piltover and Zaun, Caitlyn finds herself caught between loyalty to her city and her growing empathy for Zaun’s plight.</li>
      <li>By the end of Season 1, Caitlyn emerges as a more mature and determined figure. Her relationship with Vi deepens into a bond marked by mutual care and understanding, laying the foundation for their future partnership. Despite witnessing immense violence and betrayal—culminating in Jinx’s catastrophic attack on the Piltover Council—Caitlyn remains steadfast in her commitment to justice.</li>
      <p id="season2">Season 2</p>
      <li>Caitlyn begins the season mourning the death of her mother, Cassandra Kiramman, who was killed during Jinx’s attack on the Piltover Council. This devastating loss pushes Caitlyn into a darker mindset, fueling her desire for revenge against Jinx. As a leader within Piltover’s enforcers, Caitlyn becomes more determined and ruthless in her pursuit of justice. Her grief drives her to make morally questionable decisions, including actions that risk innocent lives, which creates tension in her relationship with Vi. Despite their growing romantic bond, Caitlyn’s unrelenting focus on vengeance sometimes shocks and alienates Vi.</li>
      <li>Caitlyn’s political role expands when Ambessa Medarda appoints her as head of Piltover’s police force. Though initially reluctant to accept such a position, Caitlyn sees it as an opportunity to protect Piltover from further chaos. However, her alliance with Ambessa—a Noxian warlord with her own agenda—complicates Caitlyn’s moral compass. As she works to consolidate power and suppress Zaun’s rebellion, Caitlyn begins to question whether her actions align with the ideals she once stood for.</li>
      <li>Throughout the season, Caitlyn’s relationship with Vi serves as a grounding force. After being separated for months, their reunion rekindles Caitlyn’s sense of purpose and humanity. Together, they face challenges such as rescuing Vander (now transformed into Warwick) and confronting Ambessa’s manipulations. These experiences force Caitlyn to reflect on how far she has strayed from her principles and help her rediscover the values that define her.</li>
      <li>In the final battle, Caitlyn plays a pivotal role in defending Piltover against Ambessa and Noxian forces. Despite suffering significant injuries—including losing an eye during a duel with Ambessa—Caitlyn demonstrates courage and resilience. She ultimately rejects Ambessa’s influence and recommits herself to protecting Piltover without compromising her integrity.</li>
      <li>By the end of the season, Caitlyn reconciles with Vi in an emotional moment that symbolizes hope for their relationship and their shared mission. Wearing an eyepatch from her injuries, Caitlyn reflects on her journey while reaffirming her dedication to justice. Her arc concludes with a sense of redemption as she moves forward with renewed clarity and strength.
